# Wrapper: Secluded
Wrapper: Secluded is a GoAnimate Server Emulator that runs on your own computer. It's like Wrapper: Offline but without the little kids using it.

## Running / Installation
Open a terminal window and run this:
```
> npm i
> npm start
```
This project does not come with Flash Player or a Flash Player-compatible browser out of the box. You'll need to find one yourself.

## Updates & Support
You're not getting it. If you have any issues with this project, then it isn't for you.

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want.
FFmpeg is under the GNU GPLv2 license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. GoAnimate's original assets (server folder) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist.

## Credits
These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper: Secluded.***
